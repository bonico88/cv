## About me

I am an Electronics Engineer specialized in DevOps, with experience designing, implementing, and operating cloud platforms in production environments, focused on reliability, security, and automation.

I have led DevOps initiatives with end-to-end ownership of infrastructure and platform operations, including containerized environments, scalable architectures, and security and compliance processes such as SOC2.

I prioritize open-source solutions for their long-term reliability and make technical decisions with cost efficiency as a key consideration.
